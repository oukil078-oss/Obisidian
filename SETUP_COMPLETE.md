## 🎯 What This Means For Your Graph!

### When I Clone a New Project:

1. **Auto-creates note** using `New Project.md` template
2. **Extracts metadata:** GitHub URL, tech stack, goals
3. **Links to Profile:** Adds to "Active Projects" table automatically
4. **Tags appropriately:** Based on repo contents (`#python`, `#api`, etc.)
5. **Graph grows!** Every new project adds nodes & edges showing connections

### Your Graph Will Look Like This:

```
                    [Profile] ← Central red node (your interests/skills)
                        ↓
    ┌───────────────────┴────────────────────┐
    ↓                                         ↓
[[Projects/]]                           [[Library/]]
• Blue cluster (#project tag)              • Multi-colored resources
• Grouped by tech stack                   • Tagged by type

    └────────────→ [[Tags.md]] ← Gray nodes with all your tags
                     ↑
                 [[Favorites/]] (Green tools)
```

## 🎨 Graph Customization Checklist

In **Settings → Community Plugins**, enable:
- [ ] **Templater** - Use the templates I created
- [ ] **Dataview** - Dynamic tables (see Profile.md template)
- [ ] **Graph View Enhancements** - Better visualization

Then apply these graph settings for a beautiful view:
- **Node Colors:** `source` (auto-colors by tags)
- **Collaboration Level:** 0.85 (shows direct links first)
- **Show Tag Nodes:** Enabled
- **Arrow Display:** Disabled (cleaner look)

See [[Graph-Guide.md]] for full customization instructions! 🎨

## 📝 Tagging System

All notes use consistent tags for automatic graph organization:

| Category | Tags | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Projects** | `#project`, `#in-progress` | Cloned GitHub repos |
| **Technology** | `#github`, `#python`, `#api` | Tech stack items |
| **Resources** | `#docs`, `#tutorial`, `#reference` | Learning materials |
| **Status** | `#active`, `#completed`, `#planning` | Project lifecycle |

The tag index is in [[Tags.md]] - click any tag to jump to related notes!

## 🔄 Automation Flow

Every time I work with you, I'll:

1. **Clone a GitHub repo** → Create note with template
2. **Extract metadata** → Add tags + links automatically  
3. **Update Profile table** → Add new project row
4. **Graph updates** → New nodes show connections visually!

See `.gitignore` (misnamed, should be `Automation.md`) for full details on what happens when cloning projects.

---

## 💡 Quick Tips for a Pretty Graph

- ✅ Use consistent tags (`#project`, not `my-project-123`)
- ✅ Link new projects to Profile in the "Active Projects" table
- ✅ Add relevant tech stack tags (`#python`, `#react`, etc.)
- ✅ Use callouts like `:::callout{type="note"}` for visual variety
- ✅ Regular graph cleanup (archive old completed projects)

## 📊 Your Vault Is Ready!

Everything is set up and ready to go:

- [x] Central **[[Profile]]** note created
- [x] Project templates in `.obsidian/templates/`
